        <h2>The First Three Weeks (Learning HTML and CSS)</h2>

        <p class="paraText">
            My initial impression shortly after starting the Coding Foundations course at Eleven Fifty Academy was very positive. I felt that the instructors were all very professional, knowledgeable, and understood many of the students initial frustrations with
            new learning. I believe that professional training is a catalyst for effective leadership, and, when combined with many of the teaching methods used by EFA staff, sets the stage for active dialogue, learner engagement, and helps foster a culture
            of collective accountability for students, which has the potential to pay dividends as the new learners enter the programming workplace.
        </p>


        <p class="paraText">From my perspective, HTML was not entirely new. I was very familiar with the basic concept wherein provides the basic framework for web pages, while CSS and JavaScript added the style and useability. Yet, it is some of the most basic HTML concepts
            which had the most impact on me. What I lacked was the general understanding of how all fit together. Many of the elements listed below were (are) incredibly important to the creation of a fluid webpage.</p>

        <p class="paraText">The two lists below include the HTML and CSS content covered in the first three weeks of the program.</p>


        <!--My challenge here is to create two columns for me to list the HTML and CSS topics covered in the first three weeks-->

        <!--I N S T R U C T O R S  N O T E
        
        Now, it might not be too terribly difficult for an EFA instructor to create side-by-side unordered lists, but I really struggled with it.  I found a lot of information online about it - which didn't help much.  So - I took my time and learned how to do this.  I am pretty pleased with how it came out.-->

                <h2>Coding - <span>Competent</span> Training Methods</span>
                </h2>

                <p class="paraText">It is a known fact that adults learn and are motivated differently than their adolescent counterparts. Academic studies have proven (time and time again) that a poor training process will produce poor learning outcomes. And as professional
                    trainers of adults, it is Eleven Fifty's job to create value for its students. This means that they have to be good at what they do. Mastering training delivery is the key.</p>

                <p class="paraText">The importance of adult learning cannot be overestimated. A literate, educated, inquisitive, problem-solving workforce is essential for any company who wishes to maintain a leadership role in their respective marketplaces. The filed of
                    adult learning encompasses the theory, research, concepts, assumptions, and guiding principles of educational experiences for adult learners. And Eleven Fifty Academy has found a way to deliver.</p>

                <p class="paraText">It is generally held that anyone can master most any task at a high level, if provided with high-quality instruction and time. The true difference between instructing and training is the production of an outcome. You can instruct someone
                    to do something, but if it wasn't understood or well received, the trainee is likely not going to produce the outcome you were originally after. However, by training someone, you are demonstrating, and expect the trainee, in turn,
                    to demonstrate the objectives. Every learning session is conducted by an expert with years of real-world experience. Learners follow the instruction in real time and reproduce the code blocks that are being taught, further reinforcing
                    their learning experience.</p>

                <p class="paraText">Acquiring knowledge is not sufficient or effective for most learning. Learners need to make sense of what they learned nd know when, where, and how to use the knowledge. <span id="italic">Understanding</span> the information is, therfore,
                    fundamental to effective learning.</p>

                <p class="paraText"><span id="emphasis">Doing --</span> Learning is often for the practical purpose of developing competence in an activity. In most situations, learning involves doing the activities. Improvement in performance requires practice over time.
                    In real-world situations, such as learning a coding language, involves all three of these learning components (knowledge, thinking, and doing). What's important here to understand is that all three of these components do not occur
                    in a separate process, but are dynamic and mutually support the overall learning process. For example, as we acquire knowledge, think better about what we are doing, and practice a task, we tend to become more competent in that activity.</p>

                <p class="paraText">The trainers at Eleven Fifty Academy allow students to put the new skills they are learining to work. In fact - it is absolutely imperative that they do - before they forget it. There are many theories for why people forget things. The
                    most improtant for coding instructors is that over <span id="emphasis"> 60% of factual information will be lost within 48 hours if there is no subsequent rehearsal or review of what was learned.</span> Skills and understanding are
                    much more resistant to forgetting. For example, if you consider the adage about riding a bike - once you learn how to ride a bike - you never forget. <span id="emphasis">The more information is reviewed in the first day or so after it is learned, the more likely the chance of it becoming established in long term memory.</span></p>

            <p class="paraText">Learning to code is a challenge. Eleven Fifty Academy has taken a log of guess work out of the equation for you by pairing coding platforms, software, and applications that work together perfectly. Students are taught from day one how to use
                utilize industry standard software packages such as <span id="emphasis">Visual Studio Code,</span> including quite a few extensions (applications) that make using VSC a breeze. Students also download and install <span id="emphasis"> Microsoft .NET, Microsoft PowerShell</span>,
                and a host of other programs, which the students get to keep after their experience at Eleven Fifty Academy.</p>
